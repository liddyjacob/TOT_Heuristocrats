# due to processor limitations, we should only run certain expensive operations every once and a while

# For example, calculating the exploration map is expensive and often redundant. 
# Perhaps we should do this only every 20 ticks or so?

# Calculating paths should only be done every once and a while, maybe every 5 ticks for exploration units, and every 20 ticks for armies? 

# For villagers, paths should be stored often

# Should have a nice interface, so that paths can be looked up easily.
